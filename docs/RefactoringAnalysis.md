## Shared Patterns Identified

1. **Component Organization**
   - Features → features/
   - UI Components → components/ui/
   - Types → types/
   - Data → feature/data/

2. **Type Safety**
   - Explicit exports
   - Readonly arrays
   - Compound component types
   - Shared base types

3. **Composition**
   - className support
   - twMerge usage
   - Children prop patterns
   - Feature composition

4. **State Management**
   - Context when needed
   - Custom hooks
   - Colocated state
   - Separated UI/business logic

5. **Panel Behavior**
   - Click outside handling
   - Escape key support
   - Relative positioning
   - Z-index management

## Next Steps

Looking at our component refactoring guidelines, we should next:

1. [ ] Review and refactor Section components
   - Analyze current section components
   - Identify shared patterns
   - Extract common functionality
   - Apply compound component pattern where beneficial

2. [ ] Evaluate UI components
   - Review current UI components
   - Apply shared patterns
   - Improve type safety
   - Consider accessibility

3. [ ] Page-level components
   - Analyze page structures
   - Extract common layouts
   - Apply consistent patterns
   - Ensure responsive design
