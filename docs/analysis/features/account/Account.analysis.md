- Feature component implementation
- Handles account UI and logic
- Manages account panel state
- Integrates with Header component

## Dependency Analysis

- usePanel for UI state
- useAccount for business logic

## Architectural Decisions

1. Implemented as feature component
2. Used compound component pattern
3. Separated concerns:

5. Added authentication placeholder
6. Integrated with Header

## Implementation Plan
