# Navigation Feature Analysis

## Current State and Responsibilities

- Implemented as a feature-based structure
- Handles menu state and routing integration
- Manages navigation items and their behavior

## Dependency Analysis

- Next.js routing
- Navigation context for menu state
- Shared navigation hooks

## Architectural Decisions

1. Moved to feature-based structure for better organization
2. Implemented compound component pattern for flexibility
3. Added context for centralized menu state management
4. Integrated with Next.js routing for type-safe navigation
5. Separated from Header logic for better maintainability

## Implementation Plan

✓ Move to feature-based structure
✓ Implement compound component pattern
✓ Add context for menu state
✓ Integrate with Next.js routing
✓ Separate from Header logic

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding route-based active state handling
- Evaluate need for nested navigation structures
- Consider adding animation configuration options
