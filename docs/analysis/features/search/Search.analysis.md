# Search Feature Analysis

## Current State and Responsibilities

- Feature component implementation
- Handles search UI and logic
- Manages search panel state
- Integrates with Header component

## Dependency Analysis

- useSearchPanel for UI state
- useSearchLogic for business logic
- useSearch for composition
- Header component integration

## Architectural Decisions

1. Implemented as feature component
2. Used compound component pattern
3. Separated concerns into distinct hooks:
   - UI state management
   - Business logic
   - Composition layer
4. Integrated with Header component

## Implementation Plan

✓ Create feature structure
✓ Implement compound components
✓ Add search panel state management
✓ Implement search logic
✓ Create composition layer
✓ Integrate with Header

## Future Considerations

- Add search history
- Implement search suggestions
- Consider adding filters
- Add keyboard navigation support
