# HeroSection Component Analysis

## Component Overview

- **File**: `src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx`
- **Lines of Code**: 92
- **Type**: Hero/Landing section with complex layout and multiple CTAs
- **Data Extracted**: âœ… Yes (`src/data/sections/hero.ts`)

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Strengths âœ…

- **Data Separation**: Content extracted to `src/data/sections/hero.ts`
- **Proper TypeScript**: Uses `HeroSectionProps` interface
- **Modern Patterns**: Uses modern UI components (Link, Section, PromoTag, etc.)
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout with responsive breakpoints
- **Clean Structure**: Well-organized JSX with clear sections

### Areas for Improvement ðŸ”§

- **Business Logic**: Contains inline logic for CTA rendering and phone plan display
- **Complex Layout**: Large component with multiple concerns (content, pricing, phone mockup)
- **Hardcoded Styles**: Some styling could be abstracted to variants
- **Component Size**: 92 lines - could benefit from decomposition

## Refactoring Opportunities

### Priority: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡

**Reasoning**: Already well-structured with extracted data, but could benefit from:

1. **Sub-component Extraction**:
   - `HeroContent` (headline, description, CTAs)
   - `HeroFeature` (feature highlight section)
   - `HeroVisual` (phone mockup and plan card)

2. **Business Logic Extraction**:
   - Phone plan selection logic
   - CTA rendering logic

3. **Styling Improvements**:
   - Extract gradient variants
   - Standardize spacing patterns

## Dependencies

- âœ… All UI components are modern/refactored
- âœ… Data is properly extracted
- âœ… Types are well-defined

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Consider compound component pattern if reusability is needed
2. Extract business logic for plan selection
3. Create variant system for different hero layouts
4. Performance optimization with React.memo if needed

## Status: **READY FOR REFINEMENT** âœ…

- Data extracted âœ…
- Modern UI components âœ…  
- Good structure, minor optimizations possible
