# Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: HeroSection
- Current Location: src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx
- Lines of Code: 86
- Number of Props: 0 (no props interface)
- Current Dependencies:

  - FeatureList
  - PhoneMockup
  - SimplePlanCard

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Homepage (src/app/page.tsx) - primary landing section
  - Currently used once as the main hero section

- Primary responsibilities?
  - Display primary value proposition ($10/month pricing)
  - Show promotional messaging
  - Provide primary CTAs (Shop Plans, Shop Phones)
  - Display phone mockup and plan visualization
  - Present key network features

- Business logic present?
  - Hardcoded pricing data ($10/month)
  - Static feature content
  - Static promotional messaging
  - No dynamic content or state management

- Presentation aspects?
  - Two-column responsive layout
  - Gradient background section
  - Typography hierarchy (large pricing display)
  - CTA button styling
  - Visual phone mockup with plan card
  - Decorative background elements with animations

- Reuse potential?
  - Low for exact reuse (very specific to current promotion)
  - Medium for pattern reuse (hero section layout)
  - High for component extraction (hero layout pattern)

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (86 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? Yes (content display, layout, CTAs, visuals)
- Mixed concerns? Yes (hardcoded content + presentation + layout)
- Reusable parts identified? Yes

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - Hero layout container
  - Hero content section (text, CTAs)
  - Hero visual section (mockup, decorative elements)
  - Hero CTA buttons

- Reusable elements:
  - Two-column hero layout pattern
  - CTA button group
  - Decorative background elements
  - Visual content card

- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Data: Move pricing, features, promotional text to props/data
  - Presentation: Extract layout patterns and visual components

- HOC opportunities:
  - withGradientBackground for section styling
  - withHeroLayout for consistent hero patterns

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 0 (no props interface defined)
- Individual props list: None
- Object props list: None 
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (0 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Should accept hero content as props:
    - heroContent: { title, subtitle, description, disclaimer }
    - pricing: { amount, period }
    - ctaButtons: { primary, secondary }
    - features: Feature[]
    - promotional: { tag, message }

- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications:
  - Static content means no prop-based re-renders
  - All content is hardcoded, limiting reusability

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Custom visual content area
  - Custom CTA section
  - Additional promotional elements

- Render prop opportunities:
  - Custom content rendering
  - Dynamic visual section

- Compound component opportunities:
  - Hero.Root (layout container)
  - Hero.Content (text content area)
  - Hero.Visual (visual/mockup area)
  - Hero.CTAs (call-to-action buttons)
  - Hero.Background (decorative elements)

- HOC opportunities:
  - withGradientHero (gradient background styling)
  - withTwoColumnLayout (responsive two-column pattern)

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None (static component)
- Context candidates: None needed
- Hook extraction opportunities:
  - useHeroContent (for dynamic content loading)
  - useHeroAnalytics (for tracking CTA clicks)
- State lifting needs: None currently

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: None (no state or props)
- Memoization usage: None
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: None

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs:
  - Component could be memoized since it's static
  - Visual section could be memoized
- useMemo candidates:
  - Feature list processing (when made dynamic)
  - CTA button configurations
- useCallback needs:
  - CTA click handlers (when analytics added)
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for content props

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component
- [ ] Nested component definitions
- [ ] Too many props
- [x] Mixed concerns (content + presentation)

### Best Practices Check

- [ ] Single Responsibility (handles content + layout + visuals)
- [x] High cohesion (all hero-related)
- [x] Low coupling (minimal external dependencies)
- [ ] Clear interfaces (no props interface)
- [ ] Proper validation (no prop validation)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in components/sections:
   - Pros: Appropriate for section-level component
   - Cons: Hardcoded content limits reusability

2. Extract to features/hero:
   - Pros: Better for complex hero functionality
   - Cons: Might be overkill for current simple needs

3. Create reusable hero pattern in components/ui:
   - Pros: Could be reused for other hero sections
   - Cons: Current implementation is very specific

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx (keep current)
- Rationale: Appropriate section-level component, but needs props interface
- Refactoring approach: Add props interface, extract reusable sub-components

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Fix deprecated GradientSection dependency
   - [ ] Create HeroSection props interface
   - [ ] Extract hardcoded content to props/data
   - [ ] Identify reusable sub-components

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Replace GradientSection with Section component
   - [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces
   - [ ] Extract HeroCTAButtons component
   - [ ] Extract HeroVisual component
   - [ ] Extract HeroContent component
   - [ ] Add analytics tracking capabilities

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test responsive behavior
   - [ ] Verify CTA functionality
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Test with different content

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Mobile responsive layout
  - Different promotional campaigns
  - Seasonal pricing changes
  - A/B testing different messaging

- Edge conditions:
  - Very long promotional text
  - Missing visual elements
  - Different CTA configurations
  - No promotional tag

- Immediate issues:
  - ⚠️ Uses deprecated GradientSection component
  - Hardcoded content prevents reusability
  - No props interface limits flexibility
  - No analytics tracking for CTAs

- Future considerations:
  - Dynamic pricing from API
  - A/B testing support
  - Multiple hero variants
  - Animation improvements
  - Video background support
  - Personalized content
