**Type:** Content Display Component
**Size:** 26 lines
**Complexity:** Very Simple

## Current Implementation

### Props Interface

```typescript
interface ProductImagePlaceholderProps {

- Responsive aspect-square design
- 2 props total

## Analysis Results

### ✅ Strengths

- **Single responsibility**: Product image display with fallback
- **Simple interface**: Only 2 props (well under guidelines)
- **Responsive design**: aspect-square maintains proper ratios
- **Graceful fallback**: Shows category when no image available
- **Appropriate size**: 26 lines (smallest component we analyzed)

### ✅ Already Well-Designed

- **No over-engineering**: Simple, focused implementation
- **Proper fallback handling**: Conditional rendering for image/placeholder
- **Consistent styling**: Uses gray color scheme for placeholders
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text when image is provided

## Compliance Assessment

### ✅ Component Refactoring Guidelines

- **Single responsibility**: ✅ Clear image display purpose
- **Reasonable props**: ✅ 2 props (well under 7-prop limit)
- **No over-engineering**: ✅ Appropriately simple
- **Focused scope**: ✅ Handles one specific use case well

### ✅ Architecture Principles

- **High cohesion**: ✅ All code focused on image display
- **Low coupling**: ✅ No external dependencies
- **Composition over inheritance**: ✅ Simple functional component

## Refactoring Changes

### ✅ No Changes Required

This component already demonstrates excellent design:

- **Minimal props**: Only essential data needed
- **Clear interface**: Obvious purpose and usage
- **Proper handling**: Image vs. placeholder logic is clear
- **Future-ready**: TODO comment indicates next/image migration planned

## Recommendations

### ✅ Already Implemented

- Component is appropriately sized and scoped
- Interface is clean and minimal
- No improvements needed for current requirements

### Future Considerations

- **next/image migration**: TODO comment indicates planned upgrade
- **Alt text improvement**: Could extract alt text generation to utility
- **No immediate changes**: Component works well for current needs

## Usage Analysis

- Used in both legacy and refactored ProductCard components
- Provides consistent image handling across product displays
- Simple enough that it doesn't need compound component pattern
