# Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: ProductBadge
- Current Location: src/components/ui/ProductBadge.tsx
- Lines of Code: 70 (after refactoring)
- Number of Props: 3 (variant, originalPrice, price)
- Current Dependencies:
  - Base Badge component
  - tailwind-merge
  - calculateDiscount utility

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - ProductCardBadges component (refactored ProductCard feature)
  - Legacy ProductCard component (deprecated)
  - Used to display product status badges (new, discount, out-of-stock)

- Primary responsibilities?
  - Display product status information as badges
  - Calculate and show discount percentages
  - Provide consistent visual indicators for product states
  - Leverage base Badge component for styling consistency

- Business logic present?
  - Minimal business logic: discount percentage calculation
  - Price validation (checks for valid originalPrice and price)
  - Content generation based on variant type

- Presentation aspects?
  - Leverages base Badge component for consistent styling
  - Variant-specific colors (green for new, red for discount, gray for out-of-stock)
  - Small size badge appropriate for product overlays
  - Bold text for emphasis

- Reuse potential?
  - High - used across product display contexts
  - Generic product status pattern applicable to e-commerce scenarios
  - Well-integrated with existing Badge component system

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (70 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? Somewhat (status display + discount calculation)
- Mixed concerns? Minimal (mostly presentation with some calculation logic)
- Reusable parts identified? Yes (leverages existing Badge component)

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits: Discount calculation already extracted to utility
- Reusable elements: Uses base Badge component appropriately
- Data vs. Presentation: Good separation (calculation in utility, presentation in component)
- HOC opportunities: None needed

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 3
- Individual props list: variant (enum), originalPrice (number, optional), price (number, optional)
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (3 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation: Individual props appropriate for this use case
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications: None (simple props, lightweight calculation)

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No (generates content based on variant)
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No (but leverages base Badge component)
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities: None (content is variant-driven)
- Render prop opportunities: None
- Compound component opportunities: None
- HOC opportunities: None

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities: None (calculation already in utility)
- State lifting needs: None

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Only when variant or price props change
- Memoization usage: None needed (lightweight calculation)
- Heavy calculations: None (simple percentage calculation)
- Prop types impact: Minimal (simple props)

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None (lightweight component)
- useMemo candidates: None (calculation is fast)
- useCallback needs: None (no callbacks)
- Prop type recommendations: Current props are optimal

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] ~~Prop drilling~~ (No prop drilling)
- [x] ~~God component~~ (Focused component)
- [x] ~~Nested component definitions~~ (No nested components)
- [x] ~~Too many props~~ (Only 3 props)
- [x] ~~Mixed concerns~~ (Minimal mixing, well-separated)

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility (Clear product badge purpose)
- [x] High cohesion (All code focused on product status display)
- [x] Low coupling (Uses utility function and base Badge component)
- [x] Clear interfaces (Product-specific props)
- [x] Proper validation (TypeScript interface with proper types)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Current Location (src/components/ui/):
   - Pros: Accessible to all components, follows UI component pattern
   - Cons: Product-specific, could be in product feature

2. Product Feature Location (src/features/product/components/):
   - Pros: Product-specific functionality
   - Cons: Reduces accessibility, used by legacy components too

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/ProductBadge.tsx
- Rationale: Generic product badge pattern, used across different contexts, leverages UI Badge component
- Migration steps: None needed (already in correct location)

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [x] Extract discount calculation to utility (completed)
   - [x] Add JSDoc documentation (completed)

2. Implementation:
   - [x] Leverage base Badge component (completed)
   - [x] Fix styling consistency with other refactored components (completed)
   - [x] Maintain API compatibility (completed)

3. Validation:
   - [x] Verify usage in ProductCard contexts continues to work (completed)
   - [x] Confirm Badge component integration (completed)
   - [x] Test discount calculation accuracy (completed)

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases: Handles missing price data gracefully (returns empty content)
- Edge conditions: Invalid price combinations handled by utility function
- Team feedback: Successfully refactored to leverage base Badge component and extract business logic
- Future considerations: Well-designed for current product display needs
