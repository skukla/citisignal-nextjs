# Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: SimplePlanCard
- Current Location: src/components/ui/SimplePlanCard.tsx
- Lines of Code: 45 (after refactoring)
- Number of Props: 4 (price, title, subtitle, className)
- Current Dependencies:
  - tailwind-merge

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - HeroSection component only
  - Used to display pricing preview in hero visual mockup

- Primary responsibilities?
  - Display pricing information in a simple card format
  - Show price, title, and optional subtitle text
  - Provide centered text layout for pricing display

- Business logic present?
  - No business logic - purely presentational component
  - Simple text display with hierarchical typography

- Presentation aspects?
  - Centered text layout with typography hierarchy
  - Purple price text for brand consistency
  - Gray title and subtitle for visual hierarchy
  - Responsive text sizing

- Reuse potential?
  - Medium - could be used for other simple pricing displays
  - Generic enough for basic price/title/subtitle scenarios
  - Currently pricing-focused but pattern is broadly applicable

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (45 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? No (single purpose: pricing display)
- Mixed concerns? No (pure presentation)
- Reusable parts identified? No (too simple to decompose further)

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits: None needed
- Reusable elements: None (component is already minimal)
- Data vs. Presentation: All presentation, no data logic
- HOC opportunities: None

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 4
- Individual props list: price (string), title (string), subtitle (string, optional), className (string, optional)
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (4 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation: Individual props appropriate for this simple use case
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications: None (simple string props)

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities: None (text-based component with fixed structure)
- Render prop opportunities: None
- Compound component opportunities: None (too simple)
- HOC opportunities: None

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities: None
- State lifting needs: None

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Only when props change
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal (simple string props)

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None (simple component with minimal props)
- useMemo candidates: None
- useCallback needs: None
- Prop type recommendations: Current props are optimal

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] ~~Prop drilling~~ (No prop drilling)
- [x] ~~God component~~ (Simple, focused component)
- [x] ~~Nested component definitions~~ (No nested components)
- [x] ~~Too many props~~ (Only 4 props)
- [x] ~~Mixed concerns~~ (Pure presentation)

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility (Clear pricing display purpose)
- [x] High cohesion (All code focused on pricing information)
- [x] Low coupling (No external dependencies beyond styling)
- [x] Clear interfaces (Obvious pricing-related props)
- [x] Proper validation (TypeScript interface)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Current Location (src/components/ui/):
   - Pros: Accessible to all components, follows UI component pattern
   - Cons: Currently only used by HeroSection

2. Colocated with HeroSection:
   - Pros: Single usage location
   - Cons: Reduces potential reuse for other pricing displays

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/SimplePlanCard.tsx
- Rationale: Generic pricing display pattern has reuse potential
- Migration steps: None needed (already in correct location)

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [x] Remove unused styling props (completed)
   - [x] Add JSDoc documentation (completed)

2. Implementation:
   - [x] Hardcode appropriate color scheme (completed)
   - [x] Simplify props interface from 7 to 4 props (completed)
   - [x] Maintain API compatibility (completed)

3. Validation:
   - [x] Verify usage in HeroSection continues to work (completed)
   - [x] Confirm visual consistency maintained (completed)
   - [x] Test typography hierarchy (completed)

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases: Optional subtitle prop handles cases where subtitle is not needed
- Edge conditions: Empty or undefined subtitle handled gracefully
- Team feedback: Component successfully simplified from 7 to 4 props
- Future considerations: Could be extended for more complex pricing displays if needed
