## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No
- Multiple responsibilities? No
- Mixed concerns? No
- Reusable parts identified? No

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - None needed, component is focused
- Reusable elements:
  - Size mappings could be shared
- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Pure presentation component
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 8
- Individual props list:
  - title: string
  - description?: string
  - centered?: boolean
  - titleSize?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  - descriptionSize?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  - titleColor?: string
  - descriptionColor?: string
  - className?: string
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? Yes (8 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Consider grouping size props into a single size prop
  - Consider grouping color props into a theme prop or use className
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications:
  - Size mappings could be moved outside component

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Could add children for custom content between title and description
  - Not recommended as it adds unnecessary complexity
- Render prop opportunities:
  - None identified
- Compound component opportunities:
  - Could split into Title and Description
  - Not recommended as current structure is simple and effective
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities: None
- State lifting needs: None

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers:
  - Only props changes trigger re-renders
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations:
  - Size mappings could be moved outside
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None
- useMemo candidates:
  - Size mapping objects could be constants
- useCallback needs: None
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Move types to header.ts
  - Consider reducing color props

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling
- [x] God component
- [x] Nested component definitions
- [ ] Too many props (8 props is slightly high)
- [x] Mixed concerns

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility
- [x] High cohesion
- [x] Low coupling
- [ ] Clear interfaces (needs type file)
- [ ] Proper validation (needs aria attributes)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in src/components/ui/SectionHeader.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Follows current convention
     - Easy to find
     - Makes sense as UI foundation
   - Cons:
     - None identified

2. Move to src/components/ui/layout/SectionHeader.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with other layout components
     - Better organization
   - Cons:
     - Additional nesting
     - Breaks current flat structure

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/SectionHeader.tsx
- Rationale: Maintain flat structure for foundational components
- Migration steps: None needed, keep current location

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Add types to header.ts
   - [ ] Move size mappings to constants
   - [ ] Document planned changes

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Simplify props (combine size props)
   - [ ] Remove color props in favor of className
   - [ ] Add role="heading" with aria-level
   - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc
   - [ ] Consider Container integration for width

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test with different content lengths
   - [ ] Verify responsive behavior
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Review size system

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Long titles and descriptions
  - Centered vs left-aligned text
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Color inheritance

- Edge conditions:
  - Very long text content
  - Missing description
  - Custom color needs
  - Extreme font sizes

- Team feedback:
  - None yet

- Future considerations:
  - Might need more size variants
  - Could add background options
  - Consider adding divider/separator option
  - Might need animation support
