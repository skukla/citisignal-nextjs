# Grid Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: Grid
- Current Location: To be created in src/components/ui/Grid.tsx
- Lines of Code: N/A (New component)
- Number of Props: ~5 planned
- Current Dependencies: 
  - tailwind-merge
  - React (no special imports needed)

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Tool grids
  - Solution grids
  - Benefit grids
  - Product grids
  - Plan grids
  - Feature grids
  - Article grids
- Primary responsibilities?
  - Layout management
  - Responsive columns
  - Gap control
  - Grid item alignment
- Business logic present?
  - No business logic
  - Pure layout component
- Presentation aspects?
  - Column configuration
  - Gap sizing
  - Responsive breakpoints
  - Grid alignment
- Reuse potential?
  - High reuse as foundational component
  - Will replace multiple grid variants
  - Can standardize grid layouts

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? [No] - Estimated ~70 lines
- Multiple responsibilities? [No] - Pure layout
- Mixed concerns? [No] - Pure UI
- Reusable parts identified? [Yes]
  - Column system
  - Gap system
  - Breakpoint handling

### Extraction Candidates

- Column configuration could be standardized
- Gap sizes could be unified
- Breakpoint handling could be shared

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 5
- Individual props list:
  - children (ReactNode)
  - className (string)
  - columns (ResponsiveValue<number>)
  - gap (sm/md/lg)
  - align (start/center/end/stretch)
- Object props list:
  ```typescript
  type ResponsiveValue<T> = {
    sm?: T;
    md?: T;
    lg?: T;
    xl?: T;
  }
  ```
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? [No]
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Keep responsive object for columns
  - Other props as individual values
- Prop drilling present? [No]
- Performance implications: None significant

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? [Yes]
- Uses render props? [No]
- Uses compound components? [No]
- Uses HOCs? [No]

### Recommended Patterns

- Keep simple props interface
- Let composition handle complex cases:
  ```tsx
  // Simple usage
  <Grid columns={{ sm: 1, md: 2, lg: 4 }}>
    <Card>Item 1</Card>
    <Card>Item 2</Card>
  </Grid>

  // With alignment
  <Grid columns={{ sm: 1, lg: 3 }} align="center">
    <Card>Item 1</Card>
    <Card>Item 2</Card>
  </Grid>
  ```
- Start simple and add features as needed [[memory:4747258]]

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None needed
- Context usage: None needed
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None needed

### State Optimization

- Component is purely presentational
- No state management needed

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Props changes only
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- None needed - component is lightweight
- Style merging is minimal

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling - None
- [x] God component - No, focused purpose
- [x] Nested component definitions - None
- [x] Too many props - All props justified
- [x] Mixed concerns - Pure layout

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility - Grid layout only
- [x] High cohesion - Props well-organized
- [x] Low coupling - No external dependencies
- [x] Clear interfaces - Props well-typed
- [x] Proper validation - Types in place

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. components/ui:
   - Pros:
     - Clear location for UI primitives
     - Easy to find
     - Follows current structure
   - Cons:
     - None significant

2. components/ui/layout:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with other layout components
     - Clear categorization
   - Cons:
     - Over-categorization
     - Less discoverable
     - Breaks current pattern

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/Grid.tsx
- Rationale:
  - Foundational UI component
  - Follows established patterns
  - Clear location for team

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create shared types (grid.ts)
   - [ ] Define column system
   - [ ] Plan gap system

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Create base Grid component
   - [ ] Add responsive columns
   - [ ] Add gap system
   - [ ] Add alignment options

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test with different content
   - [ ] Verify responsive behavior
   - [ ] Check alignment options
   - [ ] Test gap sizes

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Empty columns
  - Uneven content
  - Responsive behavior
  - Grid item sizing
- Edge conditions:
  - Invalid column counts
  - Missing breakpoints
  - Mixed content sizes
  - Overflow handling
- Team feedback:
  - Keep responsive API simple
  - Match existing grid patterns
  - Consider common use cases
- Future considerations:
  - Auto-fit/auto-fill modes
  - Grid areas support
  - Row configuration
  - Item spanning
