# Badge Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: Badge
- Current Location: To be created in src/components/ui/Badge.tsx
- Lines of Code: N/A (New component)
- Number of Props: 10 planned
- Current Dependencies: 
  - tailwind-merge
  - React (ComponentType)

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Product listings (status indicators)
  - Feature promotions
  - Status indicators
  - Icon decorations
- Primary responsibilities?
  - Display status information
  - Show promotional content
  - Indicate product states
  - Present counters/numbers
- Business logic present?
  - Minimal (discount calculation in ProductBadge)
  - Mostly presentational
- Presentation aspects?
  - Multiple sizes
  - Various shapes
  - Color variants
  - Icon support
  - Dot indicators
- Reuse potential?
  - High reuse as foundational component
  - Will replace 3 existing components
  - Useful across many features

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? [No] - Estimated ~100 lines
- Multiple responsibilities? [No] - Pure presentation
- Mixed concerns? [No] - UI only
- Reusable parts identified? [Yes]
  - Color variants
  - Size system
  - Icon handling

### Extraction Candidates

- Color system could be shared
- Size variants could be standardized
- Icon positioning logic could be reused
- Shape variants could be shared

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 10
- Individual props list:
  - children (ReactNode)
  - variant (string)
  - size (sm/md/lg)
  - shape (rounded/pill/square)
  - icon (ComponentType)
  - iconPosition (left/right)
  - showDot (boolean)
  - bgColor (string)
  - textColor (string)
  - className (string)
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? [Yes] - 10 props
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Keep individual props for clarity
  - Group colors into theme object if needed
- Prop drilling present? [No]
- Performance implications:
  - Style merging on render
  - Icon component instantiation

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? [Yes]
- Uses render props? [No]
- Uses compound components? [No]
- Uses HOCs? [No]

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop for content flexibility
- Consider compound components:
  - Badge.Icon
  - Badge.Dot
  - Badge.Counter
- Could use render props for complex content

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None needed
- Context usage: None needed
- Props for state: All stateless
- Custom hooks: None needed

### State Optimization

- Component is purely presentational
- No state management needed
- Could use theme context in future

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Props changes only
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations
- None needed - component is lightweight
- Style calculations are minimal
- No complex operations

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling - None
- [x] God component - No, focused purpose
- [x] Nested component definitions - None
- [ ] Too many props - Slightly high but justified
- [x] Mixed concerns - No, purely presentational

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility - Clear, single purpose
- [x] High cohesion - Props and styles well-organized
- [x] Low coupling - Only basic dependencies
- [x] Clear interfaces - Props well-typed
- [x] Proper validation - TypeScript types in place

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. components/ui:
   - Pros:
     - Clear location for UI primitives
     - Easy to find
     - Follows current structure
   - Cons:
     - None significant

2. components/common:
   - Pros:
     - Emphasizes reusability
   - Cons:
     - Breaks current structure
     - Less discoverable

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/Badge.tsx
- Rationale: 
  - Foundational UI component
  - Follows established patterns
  - Clear location for team
- Migration steps:
  1. Create Badge component
  2. Update existing usages
  3. Deprecate old components

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create shared types
   - [ ] Define color system
   - [ ] Plan size variants

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Create base Badge component
   - [ ] Add variant support
   - [ ] Implement icon system
   - [ ] Add shape variants
   - [ ] Add size variants

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test all variants
   - [ ] Verify icon placement
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Test responsive behavior

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Dynamic content (counters)
  - Long text handling
  - Icon sizing consistency
- Edge conditions:
  - Empty content
  - Very long text
  - Large numbers
- Team feedback:
  - Consider animation needs
  - Document color usage
  - Standardize sizes
- Future considerations:
  - Animation support
  - Theme integration
  - Custom shapes
  - Counter overflow handling
