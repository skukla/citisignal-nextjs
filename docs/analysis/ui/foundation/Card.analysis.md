# Card Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: Card
- Current Location: To be created in src/components/ui/Card.tsx
- Lines of Code: N/A (New component)
- Number of Props: TBD
- Current Dependencies: 
  - tailwind-merge
  - React (no special imports needed)

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Product cards
  - Feature cards
  - Plan cards
  - Solution cards
  - Article cards
  - Tech review cards
  - Buying guide cards
- Primary responsibilities?
  - Container styling
  - Content organization
  - Hover effects
  - Interactive states
- Business logic present?
  - No business logic
  - Pure presentation
- Presentation aspects?
  - Shadow/elevation
  - Border radius
  - Padding/spacing
  - Background color
  - Hover states
- Reuse potential?
  - High reuse as foundational component
  - Will replace multiple card variants

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? [No] - Estimated ~50 lines
- Multiple responsibilities? [No] - Pure container
- Mixed concerns? [No] - Pure UI
- Reusable parts identified? [Yes]
  - Shadow system
  - Border radius system
  - Padding system

### Extraction Candidates

- Shadow/elevation could be standardized
- Border radius could be shared
- Spacing/padding could be unified

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: ~4 planned
- Individual props list:
  - children (ReactNode)
  - className (string)
  - interactive (boolean) - enables hover shadow
  - as (ElementType) - for rendering as different elements
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

Note: Removed shadow, padding, and radius props in favor of className to match existing patterns

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? [No]
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Keep individual props for clarity
  - Props are distinct and clear
- Prop drilling present? [No]
- Performance implications: None significant

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? [Yes]
- Uses render props? [No]
- Uses compound components? [No]
- Uses HOCs? [No]

### Recommended Patterns

- Keep simple props interface
- Start with a basic card that matches existing patterns [[memory:4747258]]
- Let composition handle complex cases:
  ```tsx
  // Simple usage
  <Card>Content</Card>

  // Composed usage
  <Card>
    <div className="p-6 border-b">Header</div>
    <div className="p-6">Content</div>
    <div className="p-6 border-t">Footer</div>
  </Card>
  ```
- Avoid compound components unless we see strong repeated patterns

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None needed
- Context usage: None needed
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None needed

### State Optimization

- Component is purely presentational
- No state management needed

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Props changes only
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- None needed - component is lightweight
- Style merging is minimal

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling - None
- [x] God component - No, focused purpose
- [x] Nested component definitions - None
- [x] Too many props - All props justified
- [x] Mixed concerns - Pure UI container

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility - Container with styling
- [x] High cohesion - Props well-organized
- [x] Low coupling - No external dependencies
- [x] Clear interfaces - Props well-typed
- [x] Proper validation - Types in place

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. components/ui:
   - Pros:
     - Clear location for UI primitives
     - Easy to find
     - Follows current structure
   - Cons:
     - None significant

2. components/layout:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with other layout components
   - Cons:
     - Over-categorization
     - Less discoverable
     - Breaks current pattern

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/Card.tsx
- Rationale:
  - Foundational UI component
  - Follows established patterns
  - Clear location for team

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [x] Create shared types (card.ts)
   - [x] Document default styles
   - [x] Plan interactive states

2. Implementation:
   - [x] Create base Card component
   - [x] Add polymorphic 'as' prop
   - [x] Add interactive state
   - [x] Add default styles matching existing cards

3. Validation:
   - [x] Test with existing card content
   - [x] Verify interactive states
   - [x] Check accessibility
   - [x] Test polymorphic rendering

âœ… Component implemented successfully!

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Interactive vs static cards
  - Nested interactive elements
  - Image handling
  - Content overflow
- Edge conditions:
  - Long content
  - Deep nesting
  - Mixed interactive states
- Team feedback:
  - Keep it simple initially
  - Allow for easy extension
  - Consider common use cases
- Future considerations:
  - Loading states
  - Error states
  - Animation support
  - Media queries

## Key Decisions

1. Start with a simple implementation
   - Basic container with styling
   - Essential props only
   - No compound components yet

2. Focus on reusability
   - Generic enough for all card types
   - Flexible styling system
   - Clear prop interface

3. Consider future needs
   - Design system integration
   - Responsive behavior
   - Accessibility support
