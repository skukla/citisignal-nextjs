## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No
- Multiple responsibilities? Yes
  - Panel visibility management
  - Search input handling
  - Form submission
- Mixed concerns? Yes
  - Combines panel behavior with input handling
- Reusable parts identified? Yes
  - Panel behavior (like other panels)
  - Search input field
  - Form submission

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - Panel behavior → usePanel hook
  - Search input → Input component
  - Form handling → potential useForm hook
- Reusable elements:
  - Search input with icon
  - Panel container
- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Panel state could be lifted
  - Search handling could be separated
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 4
- Individual props list:
  - placeholder?: string
  - onSearch?: (value: string) => void
  - className?: string
  - autoFocus?: boolean
- Object props list: None
- Callback props:
  - onSearch for search handling

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Current individual props are clear
  - Could add variant prop for different styles
  - Consider adding size prop
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications:
  - No significant prop-related performance issues

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Could allow custom input rendering
  - Could support result rendering
- Render prop opportunities:
  - Could support custom result rendering
- Compound component opportunities:
  - SearchBar.Trigger
  - SearchBar.Input
  - SearchBar.Panel
  - Not recommended unless more complexity needed
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage:
  - isOpen for panel visibility
  - searchValue for input value
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None needed

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs:
  - Panel state could use usePanel
  - Search value could be controlled prop
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities:
  - usePanel for visibility
  - useSearchInput for value management
- State lifting needs:
  - Consider controlled mode support

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers:
  - Panel visibility changes
  - Input value changes
  - Parent re-renders
- Memoization usage: None
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None
- useMemo candidates: None
- useCallback needs:
  - handleSubmit could use useCallback
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Add proper event types
  - Consider controlled mode types

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component
- [x] Nested component definitions (form inside panel)
- [ ] Too many props
- [x] Mixed concerns (panel + input handling)

### Best Practices Check

- [ ] Single Responsibility (handles multiple concerns)
- [ ] High cohesion (panel and input mixed)
- [x] Low coupling
- [ ] Clear interfaces (needs type file)
- [ ] Proper validation (needs aria attributes)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in src/components/ui/SearchBar.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Follows current convention
     - Easy to find
     - Makes sense as UI foundation
   - Cons:
     - Might be better as feature component

2. Move to src/features/search/components/SearchBar.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with search functionality
     - Better organization
   - Cons:
     - Less discoverable
     - Reduces reusability

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/SearchBar.tsx
- Rationale: Keep as UI foundation for reusability
- Migration steps: None needed, current location is appropriate

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create types/search.ts
   - [ ] Extract panel behavior to usePanel
   - [ ] Document planned changes

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Use Input component for search field
   - [ ] Add proper aria attributes
   - [ ] Support controlled mode
   - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc
   - [ ] Add size variants
   - [ ] Improve focus management

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test with different content
   - [ ] Verify panel behavior
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Review focus handling

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Mobile vs desktop behavior
  - Focus management when opening/closing
  - Form submission handling
  - Panel positioning

- Edge conditions:
  - Long search terms
  - Quick panel toggling
  - Form submission timing
  - Panel overflow

- Team feedback:
  - None yet

- Future considerations:
  - Could add loading state
  - Could add clear button
  - Could add search suggestions
  - Could add keyboard navigation
