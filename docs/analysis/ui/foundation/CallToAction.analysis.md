## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No
- Multiple responsibilities? Yes
  - Content presentation
  - Feature list rendering
  - Button handling
  - Support info display
- Mixed concerns? Yes
  - Inline styles for colors
  - Mixed layout and presentation
- Reusable parts identified? Yes
  - Feature list
  - Button
  - Support text

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - Feature list could be separate
  - Button should use Link/Button component
  - Support text could be component
- Reusable elements:
  - Feature list with icons
  - Gradient section
  - Support text block
- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Pure presentation
  - No data management
- HOC opportunities: None

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 11
- Individual props list:
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - features?: Feature[]
  - buttonText: string
  - buttonAction?: () => void
  - supportText?: string
  - supportPhone?: string
  - gradient?: string
  - buttonColor?: string
  - iconColor?: string
  - className?: string
- Object props list:
  - Feature: { text: string; icon?: ElementType }
- Callback props:
  - buttonAction

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? Yes (11 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Group related props:
    - button: { text, action, color }
    - support: { text, phone }
    - style: { gradient, iconColor }
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications: None

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Could allow custom button content
  - Could allow custom feature rendering
- Render prop opportunities:
  - Feature rendering customization
- Compound component opportunities:
  - CTA.Title
  - CTA.Description
  - CTA.Features
  - CTA.Button
  - CTA.Support
- HOC opportunities: None

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities: None
- State lifting needs: None

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers:
  - Prop changes only
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None
- useMemo candidates: None
- useCallback needs: None
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Add proper event types
  - Consider HTML button attributes

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component
- [ ] Nested component definitions
- [x] Too many props
- [x] Mixed concerns (styles/layout)

### Best Practices Check

- [ ] Single Responsibility (handles multiple concerns)
- [ ] High cohesion (mixed layout/styles)
- [x] Low coupling
- [ ] Clear interfaces (needs type file)
- [ ] Proper validation (needs aria attributes)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in src/components/ui/CallToAction.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Current location is clear
     - Easy to find
   - Cons:
     - Mixed with foundation components
     - More complex than other UI components

2. Move to src/components/sections/CallToAction.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with other section components
     - Better organization
     - Matches component purpose
   - Cons:
     - None identified

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/sections/CallToAction.tsx
- Rationale: Better matches component's purpose and complexity
- Migration steps: Move file after refactoring

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create types/section.ts
   - [ ] Extract feature list component
   - [ ] Document changes

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Use Section component for layout
   - [ ] Use Button/Link component
   - [ ] Extract FeatureList component
   - [ ] Add proper types
   - [ ] Add accessibility attributes
   - [ ] Remove inline styles
   - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test with different content
   - [ ] Verify responsive behavior
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Review prop organization

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Gradient background handling
  - Feature list with/without icons
  - Support text formatting
  - Button color customization

- Edge conditions:
  - Long feature lists
  - Long button text
  - Missing support info
  - Custom gradients

- Team feedback:
  - None yet

- Future considerations:
  - More layout variants
  - Animation support
  - More feature list styles
  - Background patterns
