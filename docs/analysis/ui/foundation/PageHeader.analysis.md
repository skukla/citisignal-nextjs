## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No
- Multiple responsibilities? No
- Mixed concerns? No
- Reusable parts identified? No

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - None needed, component is focused
- Reusable elements:
  - None identified
- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Pure presentation component
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 3
- Individual props list:
  - title: string
  - description: string
  - icon: ElementType
- Object props list: None
- Callback props: None

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Keep individual props due to small count
  - Props are clear and focused
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications:
  - No significant performance impact from props

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Could add children for custom content after description
  - Could make description optional and use children instead
- Render prop opportunities:
  - None identified
- Compound component opportunities:
  - Could add PageHeader.Title and PageHeader.Description for flexibility
  - Not recommended as it adds unnecessary complexity
- HOC opportunities:
  - None identified

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: None
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: None
- Context candidates: None
- Hook extraction opportunities: None
- State lifting needs: None

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers:
  - Only props changes trigger re-renders
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: None
- useMemo candidates: None
- useCallback needs: None
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Move types to dedicated file
  - Add className support for customization

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling
- [x] God component
- [x] Nested component definitions
- [x] Too many props
- [x] Mixed concerns

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility
- [x] High cohesion
- [x] Low coupling
- [ ] Clear interfaces (needs type file)
- [ ] Proper validation (needs aria attributes)

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in src/components/ui/PageHeader.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Follows current convention
     - Easy to find
     - Makes sense as UI foundation
   - Cons:
     - None identified

2. Move to src/components/ui/layout/PageHeader.tsx:
   - Pros:
     - Groups with other layout components
     - Better organization
   - Cons:
     - Additional nesting
     - Breaks current flat structure

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/components/ui/PageHeader.tsx
- Rationale: Maintain flat structure for foundational components
- Migration steps: None needed, keep current location

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create types/header.ts file
   - [ ] Define PageHeaderProps interface
   - [ ] Document planned changes

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Add className prop support
   - [ ] Make description optional
   - [ ] Add role="banner" for accessibility
   - [ ] Add aria-label support
   - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc
   - [ ] Consider Container integration for consistent width
   - [ ] Add support for action items (e.g., buttons)

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test with different content lengths
   - [ ] Verify responsive behavior
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Review icon sizing

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Long titles might need truncation
  - Description text wrapping
  - Icon sizing consistency
  - Mobile responsiveness

- Edge conditions:
  - Very long titles
  - Multi-line descriptions
  - Missing description
  - Large icons

- Team feedback:
  - None yet

- Future considerations:
  - Might need variants for different page types
  - Could add support for breadcrumbs
  - Consider adding action buttons slot
  - Might need background options like Section
