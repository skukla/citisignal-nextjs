## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (133 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? ✅ **Yes** - Filter display, state management, UI interactions
- Mixed concerns? ✅ **Yes** - UI presentation + business logic + state management
- Reusable parts identified? ✅ **Yes** - Filter sections, filter options, active filter tags

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - **FilterSection**: Individual expandable filter section
  - **FilterOption**: Single filter option (checkbox/radio)
  - **ActiveFilters**: Active filter tags display
  - **FilterHeader**: Header with title and clear button

- Reusable elements:
  - Expandable section pattern
  - Filter option input patterns
  - Active filter tag pattern
  - Clear functionality

- Data vs. Presentation:
  - **Data**: Currently mixed - filter computation logic embedded
  - **Presentation**: Well-separated visual components

- HOC opportunities:
  - **withExpandable**: Reusable expand/collapse behavior
  - **withFilterState**: Filter state management logic

## Props Analysis

### Current Props
- Total count: 4
- Individual props list:
  - filters: FilterSection[] (required)
  - activeFilters: Record<string, string[]> (required)
  - onFilterChange: (filterKey: string, value: string, checked: boolean) => void (required)
  - onClearFilters: () => void (required)
- Object props list: filters (array of objects), activeFilters (record object)
- Callback props: onFilterChange, onClearFilters

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (4 props, well within guidelines)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - **Current approach is optimal**: Complex filter data structure needs object props
  - Individual props would create excessive prop drilling

- Prop drilling present? No (proper callback pattern)
- Performance implications:
  - **Potential issue**: filters prop could cause unnecessary re-renders
  - **Potential issue**: Complex filter computation on each render

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Custom filter option rendering
  - Custom section header rendering
  - Custom active filter display

- Render prop opportunities:
  - Custom filter option components
  - Custom section layouts

- Compound component opportunities:
  - **High potential**: FilterSidebar.Section, FilterSidebar.Option, FilterSidebar.ActiveFilters
  - Would improve composition and reusability

- HOC opportunities:
  - **withFilterState**: Extract filter logic to custom hook
  - **withExpandable**: Reusable section expand/collapse

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: ✅ **Yes** - expandedSections state
- Context usage: No
- Props for state: ✅ **Yes** - activeFilters, callbacks
- Custom hooks: No

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: ✅ **Good** - expansion state local to component
- Context candidates: 
  - Could benefit from FilterContext for complex filter scenarios
  - Not needed for current usage pattern
- Hook extraction opportunities:
  - **useExpandableSections**: Extract expansion logic
  - **useFilterState**: Extract filter computation logic
  - **useActiveFilters**: Extract active filter logic
- State lifting needs: None (proper callback pattern)

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Changes to filters prop, activeFilters prop
- Memoization usage: None
- Heavy calculations: ✅ **Yes** - filter computation, active filter detection
- Prop types impact: Complex objects could cause unnecessary re-renders

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: ✅ **High potential** - Component likely re-renders frequently
- useMemo candidates:
  - **hasActiveFilters** computation
  - **expandedSections** initial state
  - Filter option lookups in active filters section
- useCallback needs:
  - **toggleSection** function
  - **onFilterChange** wrapper functions
- Prop type recommendations: Current props are appropriate

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component
- [ ] Nested component definitions
- [ ] Too many props
- [x] **Mixed concerns** - UI + business logic + state management

### Best Practices Check

- [ ] **Single Responsibility** - Handles multiple concerns
- [x] High cohesion - Filter-related functionality grouped
- [x] Low coupling - Uses callback pattern properly
- [x] Clear interfaces - Props interface is clear
- [x] Proper validation - TypeScript interfaces

### Issues Identified

1. **Mixed Concerns**: Component handles UI presentation, state management, and business logic
2. **Complex Logic**: Filter computation and active filter detection embedded in render
3. **Potential Performance**: Heavy computations without memoization
4. **Large Component**: 133 lines suggests decomposition opportunities

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. **Keep in components/ui**:
   - Pros: Currently working, UI-focused component
   - Cons: High business logic content

2. **Move to features/filter**:
   - Pros: Significant business logic, used across features
   - Cons: UI-focused component, not feature-specific

3. **Extract to compound component**:
   - Pros: Better composition, reusable parts
   - Cons: More complex API

4. **Create FilterSidebar + useFilter pattern**:
   - Pros: Separates UI from logic, reusable hook
   - Cons: Breaking change for existing usage

### Final Location Decision

- **Chosen approach**: Refactor as compound component in components/ui
- **Rationale**: 
  - UI component with reusable parts
  - Extract business logic to custom hooks
  - Maintain current API compatibility
  - Enable better composition patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. **Preparation**:
   - [ ] Extract filter logic to custom hooks
   - [ ] Identify reusable sub-components
   - [ ] Plan compound component API

2. **Implementation**:
   - [ ] Create useFilterState hook for logic
   - [ ] Create useExpandableSections hook
   - [ ] Decompose into FilterSidebar.Section, FilterSidebar.Option, FilterSidebar.ActiveFilters
   - [ ] Add memoization for performance
   - [ ] Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Validation**:
   - [ ] Test across all usage pages
   - [ ] Verify performance improvements
   - [ ] Check responsive behavior
   - [ ] Validate accessibility

## Notes and Considerations

- **Special cases**:
  - Mobile vs desktop layout requirements
  - Different filter types (checkbox vs radio)
  - Dynamic filter options with counts

- **Edge conditions**:
  - Empty filter sections
  - No active filters
  - All sections collapsed
  - Large numbers of filter options

- **Team feedback**:
  - Component works well across multiple pages
  - Mobile responsiveness is important
  - Performance could be improved

- **Future considerations**:
  - Filter persistence across navigation
  - Advanced filter combinations (AND/OR)
  - Filter search functionality
  - Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Animation for expand/collapse transitions

## Assessment Summary

**Current State**: ⚠️ **Functional but over-engineered**
- Works well across multiple pages
- Handles complex filter scenarios
- Mixed concerns need separation
- Performance optimization opportunities

**Issues Identified**:
- Mixed UI and business logic concerns
- Complex computations without memoization
- Large single component with multiple responsibilities
- Potential for better composition patterns

**Priority**: Medium-High - Component is heavily used and has clear improvement opportunities
**Recommendation**: Refactor into compound component with extracted business logic

**Suggested Approach**:
1. Extract business logic to custom hooks
2. Decompose into compound components
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Maintain API compatibility for existing usage
