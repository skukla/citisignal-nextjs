  - ✅ **High** - Successfully used across 7+ pages with identical pattern
  - Generic filter interface suitable for any filterable content
  - Could be foundation for other filtering UIs

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (133 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? ✅ **Yes** - Filter display + state management + business logic + UI interactions
- Mixed concerns? ✅ **Yes** - UI presentation mixed with business logic and state management
- Reusable parts identified? ✅ **Yes** - Header, sections, options, active filters are distinct concerns

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - **FilterSidebarHeader**: Header with title and conditional "Clear All" button
  - **FilterSidebarSection**: Individual expandable filter section with toggle
  - **FilterSidebarOption**: Single filter option (checkbox/radio) with label and count
  - **FilterSidebarActiveFilters**: Active filter tags display with removal capability

- Reusable elements:
  - Expandable section pattern (useful beyond filters)
  - Filter option input patterns (checkbox/radio with counts)
  - Active filter tag pattern (pill-style removable tags)
  - Clear functionality pattern

- Data vs. Presentation:
  - **Mixed** - Filter computation logic embedded in render method
  - **Good separation potential** - Business logic can be extracted to utilities

- Business logic extraction candidates:
  - Active filter detection: `hasActiveFilters` computation
  - Filter option lookup: Finding options for active filter display
  - Expansion state management: `useExpandableSections` hook

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: **4 props** (within guidelines)
- Individual props list:
  - `filters`: FilterSection[] (required) - Complex array of filter sections
  - `activeFilters`: Record<string, string[]> (required) - Current filter state
  - `onFilterChange`: Function (required) - Filter change callback
  - `onClearFilters`: Function (required) - Clear all callback
- Object props list: `filters` (complex array), `activeFilters` (record object)
- Callback props: `onFilterChange`, `onClearFilters`

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (4 props - well within guidelines)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - **Current approach is optimal** - Complex filter data needs object structure
  - Individual props would create excessive prop drilling
- Prop drilling present? No (proper callback pattern)
- Type extraction needed? 
  - **Maybe** - FilterSection and FilterOption interfaces could be centralized if reused elsewhere
  - Currently colocated appropriately

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Custom filter option rendering
  - Custom section header rendering
  - Custom active filter display

- Render prop opportunities:
  - Custom filter option components
  - Custom section layouts

- Compound component opportunities:
  - ✅ **High potential** - FilterSidebar.Header, FilterSidebar.Section, FilterSidebar.Option, FilterSidebar.ActiveFilters
  - Would improve composition and enable customization

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: ✅ **Yes** - `expandedSections` state for section collapse/expand
- Context usage: No
- Props for state: ✅ **Yes** - `activeFilters` and callbacks for filter state
- Custom hooks: No

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs: ✅ **Good** - Expansion state appropriately local
- Context candidates: Not needed - callback pattern works well
- Hook extraction opportunities:
  - ✅ **useExpandableSections**: Extract expansion logic for reusability
  - ✅ **useFilterLogic**: Extract filter computation logic
  - Performance optimization hooks: useMemo, useCallback

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Changes to `filters` or `activeFilters` props
- Memoization usage: None
- Heavy calculations: ✅ **Yes** - `hasActiveFilters`, filter option lookups
- Expensive operations: Complex nested mapping in active filters section

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs: ✅ **Yes** - Component likely re-renders frequently with filter changes
- useMemo candidates:
  - ✅ **hasActiveFilters** computation (line 43)
  - ✅ **expandedSections** initial state (lines 32-34)
  - ✅ **Active filter lookups** (lines 108-110)
- useCallback candidates:
  - ✅ **toggleSection** function (lines 36-41)
  - ✅ **onFilterChange** wrapper functions

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [ ] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component  
- [ ] Nested component definitions
- [ ] Too many props
- [x] **Mixed concerns** - UI + business logic + state management combined

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility - ❌ **Handles multiple concerns**
- [x] High cohesion - ✅ Filter-related functionality grouped
- [x] Low coupling - ✅ Uses callback pattern properly
- [x] Clear interfaces - ✅ Props interface is clear
- [x] Proper validation - ✅ TypeScript interfaces

### Issues Identified

1. **Mixed Concerns**: Component handles UI presentation, state management, and business logic
2. **Performance**: Heavy computations without memoization
3. **Size**: 133 lines suggests decomposition opportunities
4. **Compound Component Potential**: Clear sub-component boundaries identified

## Architectural Decisions

### Current Architecture

- **Pattern**: Single component with internal state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind classes with responsive design
- **State**: Local expansion state + prop-based filter state
- **Logic**: Mixed presentation and business logic

### Proposed Architecture

- **Pattern**: Compound component with extracted business logic
- **Structure**:
  ```
  FilterSidebar/
  ├── index.tsx (main orchestrator, ~80 lines)
  ├── FilterSidebarHeader.tsx (~25 lines)
  ├── FilterSidebarSection.tsx (~35 lines)
  ├── FilterSidebarOption.tsx (~20 lines)
  └── FilterSidebarActiveFilters.tsx (~40 lines)
  ```
- **Business Logic**: Extract to `src/lib/filter.ts` and `src/hooks/useExpandableSections.ts`
- **Performance**: Add memoization for expensive computations

### Trade-offs

**Pros of Decomposition:**
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved performance through memoization
- Enhanced reusability of sub-components
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Compound component flexibility

**Cons of Decomposition:**
- Increased complexity in file structure
- Potential breaking changes if API changes
- More files to maintain

### Decision

**Proceed with compound component refactoring** - The benefits outweigh the costs:
- Clear improvement opportunities identified
- High usage across codebase justifies investment
- Follows successful PlanCard refactoring pattern
- Can maintain API compatibility

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Extract Business Logic
- [ ] Create `src/lib/filter.ts` with utility functions
- [ ] Create `src/hooks/useExpandableSections.ts` 
- [ ] Extract filter computation logic

### Phase 2: Create Compound Components
- [ ] Create FilterSidebar directory structure
- [ ] Implement FilterSidebarHeader component
- [ ] Implement FilterSidebarSection component
- [ ] Implement FilterSidebarOption component
- [ ] Implement FilterSidebarActiveFilters component
- [ ] Create main FilterSidebar orchestrator

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add React.memo with proper comparison
- [ ] Add useMemo for expensive computations
- [ ] Add useCallback for event handlers

### Phase 4: Migration and Validation
- [ ] Update main FilterSidebar export
- [ ] Test across all 7+ usage pages
- [ ] Verify mobile/desktop responsiveness
- [ ] Performance validation

## Future Considerations

- **Filter persistence** across navigation
- **Advanced filter combinations** (AND/OR logic)
- **Filter search functionality**
- **Accessibility improvements** (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- **Animation for expand/collapse** transitions
- **Virtual scrolling** for large filter lists

## Assessment Summary

**Current State**: ✅ **Functional but has improvement opportunities**
- Works reliably across 7+ pages
- Good API design with proper TypeScript
- Mixed concerns need separation
- Performance optimization opportunities exist

**Complexity**: Medium-High (133 lines, multiple responsibilities)
**Reusability**: High (proven across multiple pages)
**Priority**: High (heavily used, clear improvement path)

**Recommendation**: Refactor using compound component pattern with extracted business logic

**Expected Outcome**:
- **Main component**: 133 → ~80 lines (40% reduction)
- **Total architecture**: 5 focused components + 2 utility modules
- **Improved performance** through memoization
- **Enhanced reusability** through compound components
- **Better maintainability** through separation of concerns
