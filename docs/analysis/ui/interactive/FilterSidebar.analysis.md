# FilterSidebar Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: FilterSidebar

- Lines of Code: 133
- Number of Props: 4 (filters, activeFilters, onFilterChange, onClearFilters)
- Current Dependencies:

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Product listing pages (phones, accessories, plans)
  - Search results pages
  - Category browsing pages

- Primary responsibilities?
  - Display collapsible filter sections
  - Handle filter selection (checkbox/radio)
  - Show active filters
  - Manage expanded/collapsed state
  - Display option counts

- Business logic present?
  - Filter state management
  - Section expansion state
  - Filter type handling (checkbox vs radio)

- Presentation aspects?
  - Collapsible sections
  - Filter option display
  - Active filters summary
  - Clear all button
  - Option counts

- Reuse potential?
  - High - can be used across all product listing pages
  - Could be generalized for any filterable content

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? No (133 lines)
- Multiple responsibilities? Yes (filter UI, state management, active filters)
- Mixed concerns? Yes (UI state + rendering logic)
- Reusable parts identified? Yes

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
  - FilterSection component
  - FilterOption component
  - ActiveFilters component
  - useFilterState hook

- Reusable elements:
  - Section header with collapse
  - Filter option with count
  - Active filter tag

- Data vs. Presentation:
  - Filter state management → hook
  - Filter UI → compound components
  - Active filters → separate component

- HOC opportunities:
  - withFilterState for non-compound usage

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: 4
- Individual props list:
  - filters: FilterSection[]
  - activeFilters: Record<string, string[]>
  - onFilterChange: (filterKey: string, value: string, checked: boolean) => void
  - onClearFilters: () => void
- Object props list:
  - FilterSection (title, key, options, type)
  - FilterOption (id, name, count)
- Callback props:
  - onFilterChange
  - onClearFilters

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? No (4 props)
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Current structure is good
  - Consider adding className for styling flexibility
- Prop drilling present? No
- Performance implications:
  - Large filter arrays might need virtualization
  - Memoize option rendering

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? No
- Uses render props? No
- Uses compound components? No
- Uses HOCs? No

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
  - Allow custom filter option rendering
  - Custom section header content
  - Custom active filter display

- Render prop opportunities:
  - Custom option rendering
  - Custom count display

- Compound component opportunities:
  - FilterSidebar.Root
  - FilterSidebar.Header
  - FilterSidebar.Section
  - FilterSidebar.Option
  - FilterSidebar.ActiveFilters

- HOC opportunities:
  - withFilterState for simpler usage

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage:
  - expandedSections (Record<string, boolean>)
- Context usage: None
- Props for state:
  - activeFilters
  - onFilterChange
  - onClearFilters
- Custom hooks: None

### State Optimization

- State colocation needs:
  - Move expanded state to context
  - Create useFilterContext hook
- Context candidates:
  - FilterContext for state sharing
- Hook extraction opportunities:
  - useFilterState for state management
  - useFilterSection for section logic
- State lifting needs:
  - None - already lifted via props

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers:
  - expandedSections changes
  - activeFilters changes
  - filter option changes
- Memoization usage: None
- Heavy calculations:
  - Filter option mapping
  - Active filter mapping
- Prop types impact:
  - Large filter arrays
  - Deep option objects

### Performance Optimizations

- memo needs:
  - FilterSection component
  - FilterOption component
  - ActiveFilters component
- useMemo candidates:
  - Filter option rendering
  - Active filter mapping
- useCallback needs:
  - toggleSection handler
  - onFilterChange callback
- Prop type recommendations:
  - Add readonly modifiers
  - Consider immutable data

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check

- [x] Prop drilling
- [ ] God component
- [ ] Nested component definitions
- [x] Too many props
- [x] Mixed concerns

### Best Practices Check

- [ ] Single Responsibility
- [ ] High cohesion
- [x] Low coupling
- [ ] Clear interfaces
- [ ] Proper validation

## Location Decision

### Options Considered

1. Keep in components/ui:
   - Pros: Simple, already there
   - Cons: Mixed concerns, no compound components

2. Move to features/filter:
   - Pros: Better organization, proper separation
   - Cons: More complex, needs migration

### Final Location Decision

- Chosen location: src/features/filter/components/
- Rationale: Better organization, proper separation of concerns
- Migration steps:
  1. Create feature directory
  2. Move and split component
  3. Update imports
  4. Add compound components

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create feature directory structure
   - [ ] Extract types to types/filter.ts
   - [ ] Create FilterContext

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Create compound components
   - [ ] Extract useFilterState hook
   - [ ] Add proper types
   - [ ] Implement accessibility

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test all filter types
   - [ ] Verify keyboard navigation
   - [ ] Check screen reader support
   - [ ] Test performance

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Radio vs checkbox behavior
  - Empty filter sections
  - Large option lists

- Edge conditions:
  - No active filters
  - All sections collapsed
  - Very long filter names

- Team feedback:
  - Consider URL sync
  - Add search within filters
  - Support nested filters

- Future considerations:
  - Filter search
  - Filter groups
  - Range filters
  - Multi-select mode
