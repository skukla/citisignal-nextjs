# Select Component Analysis

## Basic Information

- Component Name: Select
- Current Location: src/components/ui/Select.tsx
- Lines of Code: 54
- Number of Props: Base HTMLSelect props + 2 custom props
- Current Dependencies: 
  - @heroicons/react
  - tailwind-merge

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
  - Form components
  - Filter interfaces
  - Settings panels
  - Preference selectors
- Primary responsibilities?
  - Option selection
  - Custom styling
  - Accessibility support
  - Native select behavior
- Business logic present?
  - No business logic, purely presentational
- Presentation aspects?
  - Custom dropdown icon
  - Focus states
  - Disabled states
  - Consistent form styling
- Reuse potential?
  - High reuse as foundational form component
  - Used by most form-based features

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? [No] - 54 lines
- Multiple responsibilities? [No] - Single focus
- Mixed concerns? [No] - Pure UI
- Reusable parts identified? [Yes]
  - Option type definition
  - Style variants
  - Icon handling

### Extraction Candidates

- Option type could be shared
- Style variants could be externalized
- Consider group/label support

## Props Analysis

### Current Props

- Total count: HTML Select + 2 custom
- Individual props list:
  - options (SelectOption[])
  - className (string)
  - + all HTML select props
- Object props list:
  - SelectOption { value: string; label: string }
- Callback props: Inherited from HTMLSelect

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? [No] - Minimal custom props
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
  - Keep options as array for simplicity
  - Consider adding group support
- Prop drilling present? [No]
- Performance implications: None significant

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern

- Uses children props? [No]
- Uses render props? [No]
- Uses compound components? [No]
- Uses HOCs? [No]

### Recommended Patterns

- Consider compound components:
  - Select.Root
  - Select.Trigger
  - Select.Options
  - Select.Option
  - Select.Group
- Benefits:
  - More flexible option rendering
  - Custom trigger support
  - Option grouping
  - Better composition

## State Management

### Current State

- Local state usage: None (native select)
- Context usage: None
- Props for state: disabled
- Custom hooks: None needed

### State Optimization

- Consider form context integration
- Could use custom hook for style management

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- Re-render triggers: Props changes
- Memoization usage: None needed
- Heavy calculations: None
- Prop types impact: Minimal

### Performance Optimizations

- None needed - component is already performant

## Architecture Review

### Anti-Patterns Check
- [x] Prop drilling - None
- [x] God component - No, focused purpose
- [x] Nested component definitions - None
- [x] Too many props - No, minimal props
- [x] Mixed concerns - No, purely presentational

### Best Practices Check

- [x] Single Responsibility - Clear, single purpose
- [x] High cohesion - Props and styles well-organized
- [x] Low coupling - Only basic dependencies
- [x] Clear interfaces - Props well-typed
- [x] Proper validation - TypeScript types in place

## Implementation Plan

1. Preparation:
   - [ ] Create shared form types
   - [ ] Extract style variants
   - [ ] Plan compound structure

2. Implementation:
   - [ ] Move types to shared location
   - [ ] Add proper documentation
   - [ ] Improve accessibility
   - [ ] Add group support

3. Validation:
   - [ ] Test all variants
   - [ ] Verify keyboard navigation
   - [ ] Check accessibility
   - [ ] Test form integration

## Notes and Considerations

- Special cases:
  - Option groups
  - Custom option rendering
  - Multiple selection
- Edge conditions:
  - Long option text
  - Many options
  - Empty state
- Team feedback:
  - Consider group support
  - Document keyboard usage
  - Standardize form styles
- Future considerations:
  - Custom dropdown UI
  - Search/filter support
  - Async options loading
