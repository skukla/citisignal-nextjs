## Analysis Documentation

Component analyses are stored in `docs/analysis/` with the following structure:

- `ui/` - UI component analyses
  - `foundation/` - Core UI building blocks
  - `form/` - Form-related components
  - `layout/` - Layout components
  - `interactive/` - Interactive components
- `features/` - Feature component analyses
- `sections/` - Section component analyses
- `pages/` - Page component analyses

Each analysis follows our ComponentAnalysisTemplate.md and documents:

- Current state and responsibilities
- Dependency analysis
- Architectural decisions
- Implementation plan
- Future considerations

**Note:** All recent analyses (Simple and Medium Simple components) have been standardized to follow the Component Analysis Template format for consistency.

## Next Steps

### Current Priority: Large Component Analysis

1. **[ ] FilterSidebar Component (132 lines) - HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Compound component decomposition opportunity
   - Business logic extraction potential
   - Used across 7+ pages

2. **[ ] Select Component (108 lines) - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Foundation form component simplification
   - Pattern consistency improvements

3. **[ ] Legacy Component Cleanup**
   - Remove ProductCard.tsx (deprecated)
   - Remove PlanCard.legacy.tsx (after validation)

### Strategic Approach

Following proven PlanCard methodology: Analyze → Extract → Decompose → Eliminate → Organize → Document → Validate

## Compliance Fixes ✓

### Phase 1: Over-Engineering Issues Fixed

- **Input Component**: Removed compound pattern (Root, Field, Icon, Addon), simplified to single-file prop-based approach
- **Form Types**: Cleaned up unused compound component types (InputRootProps, InputIconProps, InputAddonProps)
- **SearchBar**: Removed inline size constants pattern, aligned with user preference
- **Badge**: Simplified icon handling logic, removed complex renderIcon function

### Phase 2: Business Logic Extraction

- **URL Utilities**: Created `src/lib/url.ts` with comprehensive URL validation functions
- **Link Component**: Extracted URL detection logic to utility functions
- **ProductCard**: Business logic already properly extracted to hooks (useWishlist, useCart)

### Phase 3: Compliance Validation

- **All Components**: Verified against Component Refactoring Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility**: ✓ All components focused on single purpose
- **High Cohesion**: ✓ Props and functionality well-organized
- **Low Coupling**: ✓ Minimal dependencies between components
- **Props Count**: ✓ Most under 7 props (Button at limit but justified)
