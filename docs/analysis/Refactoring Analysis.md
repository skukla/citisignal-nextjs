## Compliance Fixes ✓

### Phase 1: Over-Engineering Issues Fixed
- **Input Component**: Removed compound pattern (Root, Field, Icon, Addon), simplified to single-file prop-based approach
- **Form Types**: Cleaned up unused compound component types (InputRootProps, InputIconProps, InputAddonProps)
- **SearchBar**: Removed inline size constants pattern, aligned with user preference
- **Badge**: Simplified icon handling logic, removed complex renderIcon function

### Phase 2: Business Logic Extraction
- **URL Utilities**: Created `src/lib/url.ts` with comprehensive URL validation functions
- **Link Component**: Extracted URL detection logic to utility functions
- **ProductCard**: Business logic already properly extracted to hooks (useWishlist, useCart)

### Phase 3: Compliance Validation
- **All Components**: Verified against Component Refactoring Guidelines
- **Single Responsibility**: ✓ All components focused on single purpose
- **High Cohesion**: ✓ Props and functionality well-organized
- **Low Coupling**: ✓ Minimal dependencies between components
- **Props Count**: ✓ Most under 7 props (Button at limit but justified)
- **No Anti-Patterns**: ✓ No prop drilling, god components, or mixed concerns

### Documentation Updates
- **Input Analysis**: Updated to reflect simplified implementation
- **Refactoring Analysis**: Added compliance fixes section

## Card Consolidation ✓

### UI Card Components Updated

#### StatsCard Component ✓
- **Simplified Props**: Reduced from 7 props to 4 props
- **Base Card Integration**: Now uses base Card component for consistency
- **Variant System**: Replaced individual styling props with variant-based theming
- **Performance**: Moved style constants outside component
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc with examples
- **Compatibility**: Existing usage in CoverageSection works without changes

#### SolutionCard Component ✓
- **Simplified Props**: Reduced from 8 props to 6 props
- **Base Card Integration**: Now uses base Card component with polymorphic Link
- **Removed Complexity**: Eliminated individual styling props for consistent theming
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc with examples
- **Compatibility**: Existing usage in SolutionGrid works without changes

#### ToolCard Component ✓
- **Analysis Complete**: Evaluated as well-designed, no changes needed
- **Props Count**: 6 props (within guidelines)
- **Architecture**: Clean, focused implementation
- **Decision**: Keep as-is - serves as good example of our patterns

#### BenefitCard Component ✓
- **Analysis Complete**: Evaluated as content block, not card component
- **Structure**: No card-like styling (background, border, shadow)
- **Decision**: Keep as-is - doesn't need Card component integration

### Business Card Components Updated

#### ProductCard Component (Refactored) ✓
- **Base Card Integration**: Updated to use base Card component
- **Polymorphic Support**: Uses `Card as={Link}` for proper link behavior
- **Consistency**: Now consistent with other card components
- **Architecture Preserved**: 
  - ✓ Compound component pattern unchanged
  - ✓ Context and hooks unchanged
  - ✓ Business logic unchanged
  - ✓ Component API unchanged
- **Documentation**: Added JSDoc with compound component examples

### Card Architecture Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All card components now use base Card for styling
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized card behavior and appearance
3. **Performance**: Reduced duplicate styling logic
4. **Accessibility**: Consistent interactive states across all cards
5. **Type Safety**: Proper polymorphic typing for `Card as={Link}`

### Card Component Hierarchy

```
Card (base component)
├── StatsCard (icon + title header + content)
├── SolutionCard (icon + description + features)
├── ToolCard (independent, well-designed)
└── ProductCard (business component in /features/product/)
```

### Props Organization Standards ✓

Established clear criteria for props interface organization:

#### **Centralized Props (in `/src/types/`):**
- **Foundational UI Components**: Button, Badge, Link, Card, Grid, Container, Section, Input, Select, ProgressBar, StatsCard
- **Multi-Feature Usage**: Components used across 3+ different features/pages  
- **Infrastructure Components**: Layout components, form components, navigation components

**Examples:**
```typescript
import type { ButtonProps } from '@/types/button';
import type { StatsCardProps } from '@/types/stats';
import type { GridProps } from '@/types/grid';
```

#### **Colocated Props (in component files):**
- **Specialized Content Components**: ToolCard, BenefitCard, NewsletterForm, ProductBadge, PromoTag
- **Single-Purpose Components**: Components with specific business context
- **Feature-Specific Components**: Components tied to specific features

**Examples:**
```typescript
// In ToolCard.tsx
interface ToolCardProps {
  icon: HeroIcon;
  title: string;
  // ... tool-specific props
}
```

#### **Feature Props (in `/src/features/[feature]/types/`):**
- **Business Components**: ProductCard, CartProvider, SearchProvider
- **Feature Context**: Component providers and contexts
- **Domain-Specific**: Types representing business logic

**Examples:**
```typescript
import type { ProductCardRootProps } from '@/features/product/types/product.types';
```

### Documentation Updates
- **Input Analysis**: Updated to reflect simplified implementation
- **Refactoring Analysis**: Added compliance fixes section, card consolidation work, and props organization standards
