## Analysis Documentation

Component analyses are stored in `docs/analysis/` with the following structure:

- `ui/` - UI component analyses
  - `foundation/` - Core UI building blocks
  - `form/` - Form-related components
  - `layout/` - Layout components
  - `interactive/` - Interactive components
- `features/` - Feature component analyses
- `sections/` - Section component analyses
- `pages/` - Page component analyses

Each analysis follows our ComponentAnalysisTemplate.md and documents:

- Current state and responsibilities
- Dependency analysis
- Architectural decisions
- Implementation plan
- Future considerations

**Note:** All recent analyses (Simple and Medium Simple components) have been standardized to follow the Component Analysis Template format for consistency.

3. **Performance**: Reduced duplicate styling logic
4. **Accessibility**: Consistent interactive states across all cards
5. **Type Safety**: Proper polymorphic typing for `Card as={Link}`

### Card Component Hierarchy

```text
Card (base component)
├── StatsCard (icon + title header + content)
├── SolutionCard (icon + description + features)
├── ToolCard (independent, well-designed)
└── ProductCard (business component in /features/product/)
```

### Props Organization Standards ✓

Established clear criteria for props interface organization:

#### **Centralized Props (in `/src/types/`):**

- **Foundational UI Components**: Button, Badge, Link, Card, Grid, Container, Section, Input, Select, ProgressBar, StatsCard
- **Multi-Feature Usage**: Components used across 3+ different features/pages  
- **Infrastructure Components**: Layout components, form components, navigation components

**Examples:**

```typescript
import type { ButtonProps } from '@/types/button';
import type { StatsCardProps } from '@/types/stats';
import type { GridProps } from '@/types/grid';
```

#### **Colocated Props (in component files):**

- **Specialized Content Components**: ToolCard, BenefitCard, NewsletterForm, ProductBadge, PromoTag
- **Single-Purpose Components**: Components with specific business context
- **Feature-Specific Components**: Components tied to specific features

**Examples:**

```typescript
// In ToolCard.tsx
interface ToolCardProps {
  icon: HeroIcon;
  title: string;
  // ... tool-specific props
}
```

#### **Feature Props (in `/src/features/[feature]/types/`):**

- **Business Components**: ProductCard, CartProvider, SearchProvider
- **Feature Context**: Component providers and contexts
- **Domain-Specific**: Types representing business logic

**Examples:**

```typescript
import type { ProductCardRootProps } from '@/features/product/types/product.types';
```
