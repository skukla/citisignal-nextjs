# Component Analysis Template

## Basic Information

- Component Name:
- Current Location:
- Lines of Code:
- Number of Props:
- Current Dependencies:

## Usage Analysis

- Where is it used?
- Primary responsibilities?
- Business logic present?
- Presentation aspects?
- Reuse potential?

## Component Decomposition

### Size and Complexity

- Over 300 lines? [Yes/No]
- Multiple responsibilities? [Yes/No]
- Mixed concerns? [Yes/No]
- Reusable parts identified? [Yes/No]

### Extraction Candidates

- Functionality splits:
- Reusable elements:
- Data vs. Presentation:
- HOC opportunities:

## Props Analysis

### Current Props
- Total count:
- Individual props list:
- Object props list:
- Callback props:

### Props Optimization

- Props > 7? [Yes/No]
- Object vs Individual recommendation:
- Prop drilling present? [Yes/No]
- Performance implications:

## Composition Patterns

### Current Pattern
- Uses children props? [Yes/No]
- Uses render props? [Yes/No]
- Uses compound components? [Yes/No]
- Uses HOCs? [Yes/No]

### Recommended Patterns

- Children prop opportunities:
- Render prop opportunities:
